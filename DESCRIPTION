Title: R-Matlab interface 
Author: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu>
SystemRequirements: Matlab 7.0 or higher.

Description: This package provides a bi-directional interface between 
  R and Matlab.  It allows Matlab users to call R functions, passing
  Matlab objects as arguments to the R functions and receiving the
  result as a regular Matlab object.  It also allows R users to call
  Matlab functions and evaluate Matlab commands from within R in the
  same fashion.  This allows users of the two systems to access
  functionality in the other in a reasonably transparent manner
  without the need to manage data from on to the other via files, or
  translating code, or programming in two languages.  Thus, advanced
  and well-tested statistical facilities become available to Matlab
  users, and toolboxes for a wide variety of different tasks become
  accessible to R users.

Limitations: 
  So far, this only works on Unix, and has only been tested on Linux.
  Mac OSX should be relatively easy. Windows requires some changes to
  the initialization and configuration. All help is gratefully received,
  especially as I do not have access to Matlab on these different platforms.
  Currently, the conversion of objects is almost complete, handling
  all the basic types such as vectors, matrices, arrays, structures,
  cells, lists, named lists for the basic types: numeric, character,
  logical, integer.  We do not yet handle the different forms of
  integers in Matlab (e.g. uint, uint8, uint64, etc.)
Note:  One needs to set the necessary environment variables to access 
  Matlab from R and R from Matlab to find the relevant shared libraries/DLLs.
  See the shell scripts in the scripts/ directory of the installed R package.
  You can find this with the command
      echo ".find.package('RMatlab')"  | R --no-save --silent
